# Discordian Date Cmdlet

This is a powershell version of the UNIX ddate utility.  It does all the same formatting, but
can also return a powershell object with properties for the day and season, etc. 

It is loadable as a module, and I'm in the process of getting it properly packaged and documented.
Also, I'd like to make the -Format and -AsObject parameters mutually exclusive.
More to come...
